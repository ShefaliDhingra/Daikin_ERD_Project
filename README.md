# Entity-Relationship Diagram for Daikin Factory Database

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** for Daikin’s factory operations to streamline **manufacturing, employee management, inventory control, and quality assurance**.

## 🏆 Objectives
- Optimize factory workflows and production tracking.
- Improve inventory and supply chain management.
- Enhance employee training and performance monitoring.
- Strengthen quality control and testing processes.

## 📊 Data & Key Entities
The database is designed to store and manage:
- **Factory**: Tracks production capacity, location, and workforce.
- **Department**: Manages different operational areas within a factory.
- **Employee**: Stores worker details, roles, and training records.
- **Product**: Monitors manufactured items and their assembly lines.
- **Process**: Details steps involved in product manufacturing.
- **Testing**: Ensures product quality and performance.
- **Material & Supplier**: Manages raw materials and supplier relationships.
- **Finished Goods**: Tracks final products, storage, and dispatch.

## 🔍 Observations
- Each factory consists of multiple departments managing distinct functions.
- Employees are assigned to specific departments and undergo training.
- Products go through an assembly line, a defined manufacturing process, and quality testing.
- Materials are procured from suppliers, checked for quality, and used in production.
- Finished goods are stored in warehouses before distribution.
- The system allows tracking of production efficiency, resource utilization, and quality control.

## 💡 Insights & Recommendations
### Insights:
- The ERD provides a clear structure for factory management.
- Linking employees to training improves workforce skill development.
- Tracking products through assembly, testing, and storage enhances operational efficiency.
- Monitoring materials and suppliers ensures quality control.

### Recommendations:
- Implement real-time tracking for production and inventory.
- Automate data entry for training completion and employee management.
- Integrate IoT sensors for better monitoring of factory operations.
- Enhance reporting for better decision-making on production bottlenecks.
